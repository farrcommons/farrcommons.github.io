###Requirements

*The requirements for the identification of resources*


###Discussion


An identity mechanism is required for research objects and their related resource for two reasons:

- **Citation:** To be able to talk unambiguously about those resources so that we can **cite** them as **evidence**.
- **Location:** To be able look up those resources.

Not all data are the same, and different identify mechanisms are suitable for different data.
The most important factor when it comes to citation is that the identifier should be **unambiguous** - that is, it should **uniquely** identify a specific resource.

A previous study by [Duerr2011][#Duerr2011] investigating the utility of identification schemes in the earth sciences breaks these requirements down further into 4 separate issues:

- A **Unique Identifier**: To uniquely and unambiguously identify a particular piece of data, no matter which copy a user has
- A **Unique Locator**: To locate an authoritative copy of the data no matter where they are currently held
- A **Citable Locator**: To identify cited data
- A **Scientifically Unique Identifier**: To be able to tell that two data instances contain the same information even if the formats are different

### Representation ####
Resources will be requested and consumed by both people and machines.

When a human requests a resource provide a human readable representation of that resource - for example a "splash page" describing a data collection.

When a machine requests a resource provide a machine readable representation of the resource.
