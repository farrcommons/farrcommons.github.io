To have their data included as part of the Farr Commons, data publishers and providers must
abide by a simple set of rules.

The core rules defined by the NIH commons vision state that:

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<h4> Rules of the NIH Commons Vision</h4>
1. Each unique research object placed into the Commons must have a unique identifier.
2. That unique identifier must allow the research object to be found, shared and attributed.
3. Attribution requires associated provenance that, minimally, identifies the creator(s) of the
unique research object, those that have subsequently modified it, and how it was modified.
</div>

The following sections describe the requirements and guidelines for the Farr Commons approach to implementing the rules for the commons.

<ul class="rule-list">
{% assign pages_list = site.pages %}
{% assign group = 'rules' %}
{% include JB/pages_list %}
</ul>
