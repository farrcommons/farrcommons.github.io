The Farr Commons will publish a set of rules for publishing data within
the [Farr Institute](http://www.farrinstitute.org/).

The Farr Commons serves as a pilot for the NIH Research Object Commons -
"a conceptual framework for a digital environment to allow efficient storage,
manipulation, and sharing of research objects".

The goal of this activity is to describe a set of [rules](/rules/) that data providers
should follow in order to contribute to an interoperable ***data commons***.
