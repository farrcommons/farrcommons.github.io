The Farr Commons aims to bring together investigators across the Farr Institute
so that they can easily and securely, share and reuse methodology and data.

To do this we will publish a set of rules for publishing data within
the [Farr Institute](http://www.farrinstitute.org/).

The Farr Commons serves as a pilot for the NIH Research Object Commons -
"a conceptual framework for a digital environment to allow efficient storage,
manipulation, and sharing of research objects".

The goal of this activity is to describe a set of [rules](/rules.html) that data providers
should follow in order to contribute to an interoperable ***data commons***.
