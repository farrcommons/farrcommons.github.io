The development of the Farr Commons is being conducted as part of the [**Health eResearch Centre** (HeRC)](http://www.farrinstitute.org/centre/HeRC/63_About.html) Community Health Intelligence Partnership Semantic Epidemiology Toolkit (CHIP-SET) activity.  

The goal of the commons is to bring together investigators across the Farr Institute so that they can easily and securely share and reuse methodology and data.

Here on the Farr Commons website we intend to publish a set of rules for publishing data within
the [Farr Institute](http://www.farrinstitute.org/).
